## How Does OKChain (OKT) Work?

Understanding the utility of OKT is relatively straightforward when compared to similar blockchain tokens that support decentralized ecosystems. For example, ADA holders use the token within the Cardano ecosystem for staking and transaction fees. Similarly, OKT tokens are used to pay for all transaction fees within the OKChain ecosystem.

OKT tokens were created and issued by the OKChain team and are available for purchase on several cryptocurrency exchanges. Users can also stake their OKT tokens to earn rewards for contributing to the network.

As the OKC ecosystem continues to grow and integrate more DeFi projects and profitable products, the value and utility of OKT may increase. The price of OKT tokens is closely tied to the success of the OKChain network and the growth of its ecosystem.

## What is the Purpose of OEC Tokens (OKT)?

OKChain relies on OKT tokens to function, similar to how the Ethereum network requires ETH for gas fees. Gas refers to the tokens used to pay transaction fees. 

As OKChain grows into a fully decentralized ecosystem, more users will engage with its products, leading to an increase in OKT transaction volumes and potentially enhancing its utility in the future.

In addition, traders frequently engage in swing trading or arbitrage with OKT tokens to profit from price fluctuations. While profitable, such trading comes with significant risks.
