**[Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=EW0H2N5E)** has emerged as a pioneer during the global expansion of crypto exchanges. It is now regarded as the leader among the "Big Three" platforms (Binance, OKX, and Huobi). Binanceâ€™s operational independence, thanks to its offshore registration and international leadership, shields it from direct domestic regulatory pressure.

### Key Features:
- **Security**: Binanceâ€™s OTC platform enforces a T+1 rule, requiring buyers to wait 24 hours before withdrawing purchased coins. This ensures added security in case of issues like receiving illicit funds.
- **Trust**: Buyers and sellers can rely on Binanceâ€™s robust dispute resolution system, making it one of the safest places for Bitcoin transactions.
