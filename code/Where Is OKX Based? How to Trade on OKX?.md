## How to Trade on OKX?

Trading on OKX involves three major steps: **Funding Transfer**, **Borrowing**, and **Leverage Trading**.

### Step 1: Funding Transfer

To begin trading, users need to transfer funds to their "Leverage Trading Account."

1. **Activate Leverage Trading**:  
   - On the **Spot Trading** page, locate pairs marked with "5X." Selecting a 5X leverage pair will trigger a confirmation popup for opening leverage trading. Carefully read and agree to the terms of the borrowing agreement.

2. **Transfer Funds**:  
   - Use the **Transfer Assets** option in the top-right corner to move funds to your leverage trading account. You can also click the prompt popup to make the transfer.

   There are three ways to transfer funds:
   - **Option 1**: On the Spot Trading page, select a 5X leverage pair and click "Transfer Assets."
   - **Option 2**: Go to the "Funds Management" page, choose "Leverage Account," and transfer funds for your desired trading pair.
   - **Option 3**: First-time users may see a funding transfer prompt on logging in.

### Step 2: Borrowing

To execute leverage trades, users need to borrow assets.

- Navigate to the **Spot Trading** page, select a 5X leverage trading pair, and click "Borrow."  
- The borrowing limit depends on your holdings in the leverage account. The maximum position is 5 times your holdings.

#### Borrowing Directions:
- If you borrow BTC in a BTC/USDT pair, it means you're shorting BTC to sell it.  
- If you borrow USDT, you're longing BTC to buy it.

### Step 3: Leverage Trading

Once borrowing is completed, you can proceed with leveraged spot trading. The transaction size will be amplified based on your leverage.

#### Trading Examples:
1. **Long ETH**:  
   - Borrow USDT to buy ETH. When the price increases, sell ETH, repay the USDT and interest, and keep the profit.
   
2. **Short ETH**:  
   - Borrow ETH to sell. When the price drops, buy back ETH at a lower price, repay the ETH and interest, and keep the profit.

### Step 4: Repaying Loans and Interest

Repayment details:
- Loans are interest-based and charged hourly.  
- Repay the borrowed cryptocurrency and interest once you're done trading.  
- Click **Repay** on the borrowed account, input the amount, and confirm.

#### Notes:
1. Interest rates are updated hourly based on supply and demand.  
2. Borrowers can lock in the interest rate for 24 hours at the time of borrowing. Afterward, the rate is updated every 24 hours.  
3. Borrowing interest must be repaid every seven days, but thereâ€™s no limit on the borrowing period.
