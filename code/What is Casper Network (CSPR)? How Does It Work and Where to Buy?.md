## How Does Casper Network (CSPR) Work?

Casper Network is described as a **first-layer Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain**, which means it operates independently without requiring validation from other networks. Its decentralized PoS consensus protocols allow for a permissionless blockchain environment, benefiting businesses that aim to build public or private applications.

### Key Features of Casper Network:
1. **Correctness-by-Construction (CbC):** Simplifies application development on the blockchain, making it accessible to developers of all experience levels.
2. **Scalability through Sharding:** Casper implements data partitioning to enable nearly unlimited storage capacity and scalability, avoiding high transaction fees like Ethereum's gas fees.
3. **Upgradeable Smart Contracts:** Businesses can easily adapt and maintain their blockchain applications without facing technological bottlenecks.
4. **Native Coin (CSPR):** The Casper Network is powered by its native cryptocurrency, CSPR, which facilitates transactions, staking, and governance.

## Use Cases of Casper Network (CSPR)

Casper Network is versatile, offering various use cases, including:

### 1. **Governance**
Holders of CSPR tokens who stake their assets receive voting rights on key policy decisions. This decentralized governance model empowers the community and aligns decision-making with stakeholders' interests.

### 2. **Network and Transaction Fees**
CSPR tokens are used to pay for transaction fees on the platform. These fees also compensate validators who power the network.

### 3. **Staking**
Staking allows CSPR holders to earn passive income by delegating their tokens to validators. Stakers receive rewards in the form of CSPR tokens, with typical returns ranging between 10-20%, depending on network performance.
