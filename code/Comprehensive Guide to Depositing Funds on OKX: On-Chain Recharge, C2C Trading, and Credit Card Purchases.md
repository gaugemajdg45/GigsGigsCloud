# Comprehensive Guide to Depositing Funds on OKX: On-Chain Recharge, C2C Trading, and Credit Card Purchases

---

## What Does "Depositing Funds" Mean?

"Depositing funds" refers to transferring money from a bank account or other payment method to a platform or exchange to enable trading or investment. In cryptocurrency exchanges like OKX, it means adding fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY) or other cryptocurrencies to your account. This step is crucial for trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, or engaging in other investment opportunities on the platform.

Different platforms might use terms like "top-up," "recharge," or "funding," but they all refer to the same process: transferring money or cryptocurrency into the platform.

For example, to buy Bitcoin on OKX, you must first transfer funds into your OKX account. Once the deposit is complete, the account balance reflects the available funds, and you can start trading. While this may seem complex for beginners, it‚Äôs similar to loading funds into a digital wallet or payment platform.
