## What is a Cryptocurrency Airdrop?

A cryptocurrency airdrop is a marketing campaign launched by crypto project teams to promote their products or services. During an airdrop, tokens are distributed for free to users who meet specific conditions or hold certain cryptocurrencies.

For newcomers to the crypto market, the term ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù might seem unfamiliar and confusing. Unlike traditional finance and investment strategies, airdrops are a unique concept exclusive to the crypto space.

Think of a crypto airdrop as akin to credit card companies offering promotional rewards to attract new customers. The difference is that airdrop rewards are often not disclosed in advance, and users must take certain actions to qualify. This unpredictability might feel daunting to some, but it hasn‚Äôt stopped investors worldwide from enthusiastically participating.

3. **Social Media Airdrops**: Participants share or repost specific content on social media platforms like Twitter or Telegram to qualify for rewards.
